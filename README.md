# Hi i'm Kian 👋

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate Cloud Engineer deeply engaged in the world of cloud infrastructure and automation. My current focus is on leveraging the power of Docker and Terraform to build resilient, scalable, and efficient cloud-native solutions. I love exploring the endless possibilities these technologies offer in simplifying and streamlining deployment processes.

## 💼 What I'm Working On
- 🐳 **Docker:** Utilizing containerization to ensure consistency across various development and production environments.
- 🌐 **Terraform:** Writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and manage cloud services.

## 🌱 Learning & Growing
Every day brings new challenges and learning opportunities. I'm continuously enhancing my skills in cloud architecture and looking forward to delving deeper into orchestration tools and cloud security best practices.
