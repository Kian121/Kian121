# 👋 Hello i'm Kian

## 🚀 About Me
I'm a passionate Cloud Engineer deeply engaged in the world of cloud infrastructure and automation. My current focus is on leveraging the power of Docker and Terraform to build resilient, scalable, and efficient cloud-native solutions. I love exploring the endless possibilities these technologies offer in simplifying and streamlining deployment processes.

## 💼 What I'm Working On

-  **AWS**: Implementing scalable cloud solutions using AWS services such as EC2 for virtual servers, S3 for scalable storage, and Lambda for serverless computing. Focused on optimizing cost and performance in a secure cloud environment.
-  **Azure**: Deploying and managing applications in Microsoft Azure, utilising a range of Azure services including Azure Functions for serverless computing, Azure SQL Database for managed database services, and Azure Active Directory for identity services.
-  **Docker**: Utilizing containerization to ensure consistency across various development and production environments.
-  **Terraform**: Writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate and manage cloud services.

## 🌱 Learning & Growing
Every day presents fresh challenges and opportunities for learning. As I continue to enhance my skills in cloud architecture, I find myself increasingly excited to delve deeper into the expansive world of technology. My journey has taught me that the field is not just about mastering tools and techniques; it's also about understanding the ways in which these technologies can transform businesses and impact lives. Looking ahead, I'm eager to explore emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, and to leverage my growing expertise to solve complex problems and drive progress in this dynamic industry.
